Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. These networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information through a weighted sum of inputs followed by a nonlinear activation function.

A basic neural network has three types of layers:
- Input layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden layers: One or more layers that perform computations
- Output layer: Produces the final result

Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that determines the strength of the connection. During training, these weights are adjusted to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. This process, called backpropagation, uses gradient descent to update weights.

Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers. These deep networks can learn hierarchical representations of data, with early layers detecting simple features like edges, and deeper layers combining these into complex patterns.

Popular neural network architectures include:
- Feedforward Networks: Basic networks where information flows in one direction
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image data
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data
- Transformers: Modern architecture powering large language models

Training neural networks requires large datasets, powerful GPUs, and careful hyperparameter tuning. Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other domains. However, they remain "black boxes" whose internal workings are often difficult to interpret.
